# Optimized CI for VS Code Extension (pnpm)
# ---------------------------------------
# Based on pnpm official CI recommendations:
# https://pnpm.io/continuous-integration
#
# Goals:
# - Deterministic installs using pnpm-lock.yaml
# - Explicit and reliable pnpm store caching
# - Low maintenance, low noise
# - Compile-only validation (no tests yet)
