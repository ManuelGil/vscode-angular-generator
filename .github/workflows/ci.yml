# CI for VS Code Extension
# -----------------------
# Recommended baseline workflow for VS Code extensions written in TypeScript.
#
# Goals:
# - Validate Pull Requests only (low noise)
# - Ensure dependencies install correctly using pnpm
# - Ensure the extension compiles (tsc)
#
# This workflow intentionally:
# - Uses `pnpm compile` (standard for VS Code extensions)
# - Does not run tests (none exist yet)
# - Avoids unnecessary steps and complexity

name: CI

# Run CI only on Pull Requests targeting main
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  compile:
    # Ubuntu is the standard and most stable runner for VS Code extensions
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Checkout repository source code
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Setup Node.js using .nvmrc
      # This keeps local dev, CI, and Dependabot in sync
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version-file: ".nvmrc"
          cache: "pnpm"

      # Setup pnpm
      # Pinning the major version avoids unexpected breaking changes
      - name: Setup pnpm
        uses: pnpm/action-setup@v4
        with:
          version: 9

      # Install dependencies
      # --frozen-lockfile guarantees reproducible installs
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

      # Compile the extension
      # This typically runs `tsc` and validates the extension code
      - name: Compile extension
        run: pnpm compile
