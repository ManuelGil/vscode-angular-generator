# CI for VS Code Extension
# -----------------------
# This workflow validates Pull Requests before merging into main.
#
# Design goals:
# - Low maintenance and low noise
# - Deterministic Node version via .nvmrc
# - pnpm-based dependency management
# - Compile-only check (no tests yet)
#
# This is the recommended baseline CI for a VS Code extension.

name: CI

# Run CI only on Pull Requests targeting main
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  compile:
    # Ubuntu is the standard and most stable runner for VS Code extensions
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Checkout repository source code
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Setup pnpm
      # - Installs a pinned pnpm version
      # - Enables native pnpm store caching
      # - More reliable on modern Ubuntu runners than setup-node caching
      - name: Setup pnpm
        uses: pnpm/action-setup@v4
        with:
          version: 10
          cache: true

      # Setup Node.js runtime
      # - Uses .nvmrc as the single source of truth
      # - No dependency caching here (handled by pnpm)
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version-file: ".nvmrc"

      # Install dependencies
      # - Ensures pnpm-lock.yaml is respected
      # - Fails fast if the lockfile is out of sync
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

      # Compile VS Code extension
      # - Typically runs TypeScript compilation (tsc)
      # - Core validation step for this project
      - name: Compile extension
        run: pnpm compile
