# CI for VS Code Extension
# -----------------------
# This workflow validates Pull Requests before merging into main.
#
# Design goals:
# - Low maintenance and low noise
# - Deterministic Node version via .nvmrc
# - pnpm-based dependency management
# - Compile-only check (no tests yet)
#
# This is the recommended baseline CI for a VS Code extension.

# Run CI only on Pull Requests targeting main

  pull_request:

jobs:
  compile:
    # Ubuntu is the standard and most stable runner for VS Code extensions
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:

          node-version-file: ".nvmrc"

      # Install pnpm explicitly (guarantees PATH availability)
      - name: Install pnpm
        run: npm install -g pnpm@10

      # Verify pnpm is available (debug + safety)
      - name: Verify pnpm
        run: pnpm --version

      # Install dependencies (strict & reproducible)
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

      # Compile VS Code extension
      - name: Compile extension
