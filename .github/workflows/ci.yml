# CI for VS Code Extension
# -----------------------
# This workflow runs on Pull Requests targeting the main branch.
# It ensures that the extension installs dependencies correctly
# and that the TypeScript sources compile without errors.
#
# Scope:
# - Node.js version is defined by .nvmrc
# - Dependencies are managed with pnpm
# - Only compilation is verified (no tests are executed)
