# CI for VS Code Extension
# -----------------------
# This workflow validates Pull Requests before merging into main.
#
# Design goals:
# - Low maintenance and low noise
# - Deterministic Node version via .nvmrc
# - pnpm-based dependency management
# - Compile-only check (no tests yet)
#
# This is the recommended baseline CI for a VS Code extension.

name: CI

# Run CI only on Pull Requests targeting main
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  compile:
    # Ubuntu is the standard and most stable runner for VS Code extensions
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Checkout repository source code
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Setup Node.js using the exact version defined in .nvmrc (24.13.0)
      # Enables pnpm caching based on pnpm-lock.yaml
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version-file: ".nvmrc"
          cache: "pnpm"
          # make cache key depend on the lockfile explicitly
          cache-dependency-path: "pnpm-lock.yaml"

      # Enable and activate pnpm via Corepack (recommended approach)
      - name: Enable pnpm via Corepack
        run: |
          corepack enable
          corepack prepare pnpm@10 --activate

      # Optional but useful: verify pnpm is available
      - name: Verify pnpm installation
        run: pnpm --version

      # Install dependencies
      # --frozen-lockfile ensures the lockfile is respected
      # and fails the CI if dependencies are out of sync
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

      # Compile the VS Code extension
      # This typically runs `tsc` and validates TypeScript correctness
      # This step is intentionally mandatory
      - name: Compile extension
        run: pnpm compile
