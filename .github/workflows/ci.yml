# CI for VS Code Extension
# -----------------------
# This workflow validates Pull Requests before merging into main.
#
# Design goals:
# - Low maintenance and low noise
# - Deterministic Node version via .nvmrc
# - pnpm-based dependency management
# - Compile-only check (no tests yet)
#
# This is the recommended baseline CI for a VS Code extension.
